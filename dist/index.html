        	      <h1>The Edge of Knowledge</h1>
                <h2>A Documentary feature film about the quest to understand the black hole</h2>
                <p class="description">Black holes pose puzzles at the frontier of physics, mathematics, astronomy, and philosophy.  Following Stephen Hawking’s last work, tracking the worldwide efforts of the Event Horizon Telescope, the film is an inquiry into the limits of what we can predict, what we can see, what we can know.</p>
